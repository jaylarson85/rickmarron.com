During the summer of 2012, I spent four months on the Appalachian Trail. As I look back on that experience, what stands out to me isn't the encounters with moose and bears. Its not the impeccable nights spent on the White Mountains, and it isn't the run-ins with peculiar mountain men. What stands out now, two years later, is the incredible focus that the Appalachian Trail allowed.

Throughout those four months, I had a single goal: hike to Mt. Katahdin. This goal captivated and consumed me. Every action I took was focused on achieving it. When I went into a town to buy groceries, I counted the ounces for each purchase. Ensuring it wouldn't weigh me down. When I was going to sleep, I would read my maps and guide books to plan out the next day. When I ate, I would keep meals small, so I could immediately continue to hike. 

With this all-encompassing goal, everything became simple. When I woke up in the morning, I knew exactly what I was doing that day; I was walking. I never checked my calendar for meetings or appointments. I never debated whether it was more important to write this email or create that presentation. No. It was simple. I was walking, and if I wasn't walking, I was doing something so I could start walking again.

This simplicity was amplified by the lack of distractions to form an almost meditative state. There were no cell phones or emails to derail my train of thought. I was able to think deeply on topics for hours, and I was forced to be creative. This state of mind is what I remember and miss the most about the Appalachian Trail.

Since finishing my hike and starting my role at Microsoft, it has been very difficult to recreate this meditative state. However, it is something that I am striving to do. I am trying to set clear goals for myself, keep things simple, and minimize my distractions. In doing so, I hope to bring this aspect of the Appalachian Trail to my current life.
