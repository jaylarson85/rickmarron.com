    <p>During the summer of 2012, I spend four months on the Appalachian Trail. As I look back on that experience, what stands out to me isn&#39;t the encounters with moose and bears. Its not the impeccable nights spent on the White Mountains, and it isn&#39;t the run-ins with peculiar mountain men. What stands out now, two years later, is the incredible focus that the Appalachian Trail allowed.</p>

<p>Throughout those four months, I had a single goal: hike to Mt. Katahdin. This goal captivated and consumed me. Every action I took was focused on achieving it. When I went into a town to buy groceries, I counted the ounces for each purchase. Ensuring it wouldn&#39;t weigh me down. When I was going to sleep, I would read my maps and guide books to plan out the next day. When I ate, I would keep meals small, so I could immediately continue to hike. </p>

<p>With this all-encompassing goal, everything became simple. When I woke up in the morning, I knew exactly what I was doing that day; I was walking. I never checked my calendar for meetings or appointments. I never debated whether it was more important to write this email or create that presentation. No. It was simple. I was walking, and if I wasn&#39;t walking, I was doing something so I could start walking again.</p>

<p>This simplicity was amplified by the lack of distractions to form an almost meditative state. There were no cell phones or emails to derail my train of thought. I was able to think deeply on topics for hours, and I was forced to be creative. This state of mind is what I remember and miss the most about the Appalachian Trail.</p>

<p>Since finishing my hike and starting my role at Microsoft, it has been very difficult to recreate this meditative state. However, it is something that I am striving to do. I am trying to set clear goals for myself, keep things simple, and minimize my distractions. In doing so, I hope to bring this aspect of the Appalachian Trail to my current life.</p>
